Robert Kane, Jr. Portfolio Site (Frontend)

This project was built to showcase my other projects to date while practicing my full stack development skills. It is an ongoing project as I continue to build out more features and expand its functionality. I'm currently working to get the contact form on the backend to submit to my email correctly using Google Cloud Platform, GoogleAPIs, and OAuth 2.0. 

The site consists of a homepage that displays my projects, an about page with information about me, and a contact form page where users can send messages directly to my email.

The backend is in a separate repo that can be viewed here - https://github.com/robertkanejr/portfolio-backend

Technologies used:
Frontend - JavaScript, React, React Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Axios, Netlify
Backend - Express, NodeJS, Nodemailer, CORS, Google Cloud Platform, GoogleAPIs, OAuth 2.0, Heroku

Dependencies: axios, bootstrap, dotenv, react, react-bootstrap, react-router-dom, react-slick, slick-carousel

How to run it:
Frontend - npm start
Backend - node server.js
