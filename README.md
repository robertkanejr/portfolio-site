Robert Kane, Jr. Portfolio Site (Frontend)

This project was built to showcase my projects to date while practicing my full stack development skills. It is an ongoing project as I continue to build out more features and expand its functionality. I'm currently working to get the contact form on the backend to submit to my email correctly.

The site consists of a homepage that displays my projects, an about page with information about me, and a contact form page where users can send messages to directly to my email.

The backend is in a separate repo that can be viewed here - https://github.com/robertkanejr/portfolio-backend

Technologies used:
Frontend - JavaScript, React, React Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Axios, Netlify
Backend - Express, NodeJS, Nodemailer, GoogleAPIs, CORS, Heroku

How to run it
